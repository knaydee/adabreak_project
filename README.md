# [Giftees](https://giftee.herokuapp.com/)

The first break project for Ada Developers Academy, cohort 4 was to develop a Rails application. This application required that the following guidelines be met:
  - At least two models that have some sort of relationship to one another
    - Giftee models: giftee and wishlist
  - At least two controllers that handle actions for the two models
    - Giftee controllers: giftees and wishlists
  - The basic set of CRUD operations associated with each models
    - This requires routes, views, controller methods, etc.
  - Pushed to GitHub

The idea behind Giftees is to track gift ideas. It allows the user to create wish lists for their various friends and family members. (a.k.a. Giftees). Wish lists track the gift's price and whether it was purchased. Items on this list are editable and can also be removed. Ditto for Giftees. Currently, it boasts a winter holiday theme, but future iterations will incorporate other themes (i.e., birthdays, get well, thank yous, etc). The hope is that future versions will also allow for more Giftee attributes, like size, height, weight, favorite color, etc., as well as gift attributes, like various locations where it is available and resulting prices. This is only the beginning...
